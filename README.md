# Pyspark
This involves all my work done on pyspark.
To execute these files you can download them and execute them on Databrics cloud platform or even jupytor notebook or Zeppelin notebook etc..
Please make sure to create spark builder session.
While creating Dataframe, specify your data path to load file.
I have added all the data I used in data folder.
